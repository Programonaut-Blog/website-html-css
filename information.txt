index.html size: 3050 Bytes -> 3.0 KB

Overall opinion:
- straighforward process
- its hard to find suitable css class or id names
- its a little bit annoying to swap between two files
- the responsivness works, but could be improved upon

- happy with the end result
-> legit way of building a website
